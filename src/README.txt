How to run this program: Upon launch of the application, the end-user will be prompted to enter their credentials (username and password). Valid users will then be taken to the main screen where they will be able to add, modify, and delete customer/appointment data. The end-user can also view reports queried from the database.

Additional Report Info: The third report will show the total number of appointments for each division. This would be a beneficial report to help identify personnel needs at each of the main offices.
